# RV's Dotfiles

Hello, there!

Welcome to my dotfiles repository. I keep here all of my dotfiles for various software I use, like [QTile](https://qtile.org/) and [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/).

Dotfiles are files whose names begin with a period (`.`) and are generally hidden. They are used by software to store configuration settings.

Feel free to take anything from it. You can use the entire dotfiles setup as it is, but it is recommended that you go through all the files first and understand what they do.
